The Helikopter-Oscilloscope is a JAVA based program and is run to visualise the incoming data. To run the software, it is important that the build path contains all the necessary libraries. This is done by adding the libraries to the Reference Library such as jfreechart, jcommon etc. Also exclude RXTXComm.src from the Source files.
